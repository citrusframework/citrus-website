    <p>Obviously we need something to test in the samples section. The todo-list is a very simple sample application that represents the system under test for the Citrus samples. This
    todo application provides an API for adding, removing and changing todo entries.</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>The todo-list sample application should be both simple but yet capable to act as service in a fully qualified integration test
    scenario. The application provides a REST API for accessing the todo entries via Http.</p>

    <h3>Build</h3>

    <p>The sample application uses Maven as build tool. So you can compile, package and test the
    sample with Maven.</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn clean install</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>This executes the complete Maven build lifecycle and creates the sample artifacts that are used throughout the other samples.
    The build application represents the system under test.</p>

    <h3>Run</h3>

    <p>The application is a Spring Boot web application that you can deploy on any web container. Of course Spring Boot provides many other fantastic
    ways of starting the application.</p>

    <p>On of these possibilities is the Spring Boot Maven Plugin. You can start the sample todo list application with this command.</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn spring-boot:run</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>This starts the application in a Tomcat web container and automatically deploys the todo list app. Point your browser to</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>http://localhost:8080/todolist/</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>You will see the web UI of the todo list. Now add some new todo entries manually and you are ready to go.</p>

    <p>Now we are ready to execute some Citrus tests. Choose one of the Citrus <b><a href="/samples/">samples</a></b> folders and read the instructions on how to interact with the
    todo application.</p>
