## Testing Camel K integrations with Cloud Native BDD
### Presentation from ApacheCon 2020

Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform built from Apache Camel. 
Integrations built with Camel K run natively on Kubernetes and are specifically designed for serverless architectures.
With the declarative nature in Camel K users can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud. 
The presentation outlines typical integration scenarios with Camel K and shows how to write automated tests for these enterprise integrations. 
The session covers classical service provider/consumer scenarios with common messaging protocols (e.g. REST, JMS, Kafka) 
as well as more complex integrations with data access and 3rd party Saas services included. 
The tests itself will also be Cloud Native citizens and make use of Behavior Driven Development concepts.

## Citrus TestTalks Interview
### Integration Automation Using Citrus Testing Framework

Joe Colantonio talks to Christoph Deppisch about automate integration tests for pretty much any messaging protocol or data format.
So if youâ€™re looking to expand your automation efforts beyond lame, flaky, UI-based automated tests, this episode is for you.

## BDD Integration with Citrus & Cucumber
### Citrus "Tools in action" session @DevoxxBE 2017

The concept of behavior driven development (BDD) is quite simple. 
Business analysts and domain experts describe how the application should behave using Gherkin (given-when-then) feature stories.
Developers glue those specifications to automated tests. 
Can we use this approach when testing the integration of services, too? 
The talk gives answers with a combination of the frameworks Cucumber and Citrus.
After a short introduction to both frameworks we discuss the concepts and see some code examples that demonstrate how 
the behavior driven approach fits to testing the messaging integration with Http REST, JMS and mail communication.
At the end we will have an automated integration test with BDD and almost no glue code to write manually.

Citrus integrates with frameworks like Apache Camel, Arquillian, Kubernetes and Docker in order to provide automated integration 
testing of Microservice applications. 
The tools in action session gives a brief introduction to the Citrus framework and shows code samples for a complete integration 
test scenario in a Microservices environment.
